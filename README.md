# Book Price Tracker

## Description
This project is an automation bot designed to track the price of books online. Using web scraping techniques, the bot checks the price daily. If it detects a discount of under $20, it sends me a notification via Gmail using SMTP. This allows me to stay informed about price drops and take advantage of discounts without having to manually check multiple websites.
